    "This project implements a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Deep Learning model capable of translating English sentences into German. Unlike standard Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approaches, this implementation utilizes an Attention Mechanism to solve the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the decoder to \"focus\" on relevant parts of the input sentence at each generation step.\n",
